This is a replacement part for the handle or crank that opens or closes a casement or awning window.
It presses tightly onto a metal spline to attach to the window, and is turned to actuate it.
The metal spline it fits with has 11 teeth and an outer diameter of 3/8 inch.

The FreeCAD file is provided for modification, or the STL can be printed directly. 
I printed mine in PLA on a Prusa MINI with default settings and no support material.
